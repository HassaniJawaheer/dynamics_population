# Dynamics Population

This repository contains the analysis and simulation of stochastic and deterministic population dynamics models. The models are implemented using Python libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ipywidgets`, and others.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment

To keep dependencies isolated, it's recommended to create a Python virtual environment. You can create one with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment depending on your operating system:

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes the necessary libraries, such as:

```txt
numpy
matplotlib
ipywidgets
notebook
ipython
```

### 4. Running the Jupyter Notebook

After installing the dependencies, you can launch the Jupyter Notebook to explore the models:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then, open the notebook from your browser to run and visualize the simulations.
